# CaesarGuiApp
A Java GUI application for decrypting/encrypting text with the Caesar cipher

# Installation and Settings:

- You must have Java installed on your computer, which you can download from here: <https://java.com/en/download/> 

- Windows users: Run the app by just double-clicking the Caesar.jar file -- lucky Windows users that's all you have to do :)

- Linux users: Open your terminal, navigate to the folder where the Caesar.jar file is located and type: java -jar Caesar.jar

- Mac users: I'm not sure but I assume it's as easy as the Windows users... (I will get back on this soon)

# User's Manual:

- Run the program, check out the GUI visual interface that will appear on the screen.

- From the top menu bar you can select three options: File, Settings, and Help.

Under the "File" drop down menu you can select three options:

- Open -- opens a file and displays it's contents in the input text area.

- Save -- saves the contents from the output text area into a file.

- Exit -- exits the application.

Under the "Settings" drop down menu you can select two options:

- English dictionary -- the default selected which uses a 10k English words dictionary to crack the encrypted code.

- Brute force -- is the other option that you can select to get the 25 key versions of the encrypted text.

Under the "Help" drop down menu currently there is only one option:

- About -- displays information about the software version, the author(s), and the GNU GPL 3.0 LICENSE.

- *Soon, I will add this or similar user's manual as another option under the "Help" drop down menu...

How to Encrypt your message you ask?

- 1. Type you plain text message in the input text area or just open your text file from the File > Open menu option.

- 2. Select "Brute force" from the "Settings" drop down menu and click the "Crack it" button.

- 3. The display text area will display all 25 key encrypted version of your text.

- 4. Copy and Paste the version you like and send it to your recipient...

- 5. Or use the "Save" option under the "File" drop down menu to save all of the encrypted versions to a file for later use...
